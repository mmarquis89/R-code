X,998,VLP,VGlut-F-100009,39D07-style LHNs
XVII,2,LH,fru-M-200253,Generally local to the LH. Mostly lateral/posterior cell bodies.
XVII,14,LH,fru-M-700164,"Seem to be mostly local 23F06-style neurons, but a fair number spill into the SLP"
XVII,339,SLP,Cha-F-100223,Not very well defined group…both anterior and posterior cell bodies.
XVII,360,SIP?,Cha-F-400179,Posterior cell bodies. Distinctive arborization in what I think might be the SIP.
XVII,366,"SLP, SIP?",Cha-F-200185,"Similar to #360, but projections extend more medial…possibly to the SIP?"
XVII,455,SLP,VGlut-F-600764,"Posterior-lateral cell bodies, project to the lateral SLP. Look kind of like 28A10, but neurite branches earlier."
XVII,440,SLP,VGlut-F-600716,Heterogeneous group of neurons arborizing in the ventral/medial LH and going to the SLP.
