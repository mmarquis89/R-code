2,XVII,100,2,"SLP, PLP, SMP",fru-M-300168,"Very similar to cluster 28, but more cells. A few extend processes to the smp."
3,XVII,109,3,"SMP, PLP?, ICL?, SCL?",fru-M-500088,"Interesting and distinct ring-like arborizations along the LH-SMP, SMP-PLP borders and around the MB Ped."
4,XVII,167,4,"SLP, PLP, ICL, SCL, SMP",Trh-M-100074,Wraps around MB peduncle and innervates specific portions of SLP and SMP.
5,XVII,472,5,"SLP, PLP?",fru-F-700078,"Maybe local to SLP, or may also be in superior PLP a bit."
6,XVII,623,6,"SLP, SMP",fru-F-300016,
7,XIX,10,7,"SIP, SMP, sip",fru-M-000174,A couple also go to smp. Very specific innervation of the posterior-medial arm of the SMP.
8,XIX,36,8,"SMP, SIP?",fru-M-200340,Dense arborization throughout SMP and (I think) also SIP.
9,XIX,83,9,"FB, SMP, SLP?",TH-M-300024,Arborizes in the FB and along the posterior SMP/SLP border. See cluster 189.

12,XIX,95,10,"SMP, FLA?",fru-M-000064,"Versy dense innervation of SMP, with a specific projection to a small area that I think is the doral tip of the FLA."
13,XIX,107,11,"SMP, CRE, cre",fru-M-600033,Hard to tell exactly where this is. Similar to cluster 186.
